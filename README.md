Using Linear Regression to predict pulsar Star

Predicitng a pulsar star :

what is a pulsar star ????????

A pulsar (from pulse and -ar as in quasar)[1] is a highly magnetized
rotating neutron star or white dwarf that emits a beam of electromagnetic
radiation. This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission
is pointing toward Earth (much like the way a lighthouse can be seen only
when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is 
responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very
dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very
precise interval between pulses that range from milliseconds to seconds
for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are believed to be one of the candidates
of the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (see also centrifugal mechanism
                                               of acceleration).

This problem is a regression as well as classification problem
we can solve it using regression or classification.
How problem can be solved using Regression ?? as the label that is the class is dependent variable ,that is dependent on the features this problem can be solved using regression becuase in regression their is a relationship between dependent and independent variable. This is also a Multiplt Linear Regression example.

How problem can be solved using Classification ?? here we have two distinct values for class , that is if value is that means it is a pulsar star and if value is 0 that means is it not a pulsar star so it is a classification problem where we can classify the two classes based on features.
